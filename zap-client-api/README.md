## Introduction

The ZAP Client API is a project built on top of the [ZAP Java API](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/ApiJava). It creates a layer of abstraction over all the calls to ZAP's API, simplifying the configuration and execution process for applications that want to use ZAP. Moreover, the ZAP Client API adds support for [CAS](http://jasig.github.io/cas/) authentication, not supported by default by ZAP or its API.

## Usage

To use the API, just add the following dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>br.com.softplan.security.zap</groupId>
	<artifactId>zap-client-api</artifactId>
	<version>${zap.client.api.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Available versions can be found [here](). TODO: add link to Maven Central when the artifact is available there.

## API

The API's main class is [`ZapClient`](src/main/java/br/com/softplan/security/zap/api/ZapClient.java), which receives an instance of [`ZapInfo`](../zap-utils/src/main/java/br/com/softplan/security/zap/commons/ZapInfo.java) in its constructor and, optionally, an instance of [`AuthenticationInfo`](src/main/java/br/com/softplan/security/zap/api/model/AuthenticationInfo.java) for analysis with authentication. `ZapClient` has only one public method: `analyze()`. This method starts a ZAP analysis and receives as parameter an instance of [`AnalysisInfo`](src/main/java/br/com/softplan/security/zap/api/model/AnalysisInfo.java).

To use the API, one just needs to create those objects and call `analyze()`. The analysis output are the reports generated by ZAP, represented by an instance of the [`ZapReport`](src/main/java/br/com/softplan/security/zap/api/report/ZapReport.java) class.

### ZapInfo

This class keeps all the necessary information regarding the ZAP instance that will be used. A builder is provided to make it easier to create objects of this class. It has three main methods:

- `buildToUseRunningZap()`
- `buildToRunZap()`
- `buildToRunZapWithDocker()`

As it's clear by the methods' names, besides being possible to run an analysis with a running instance of ZAP, it's also possible to automatically start ZAP - via local installation or docker - to run the analysis. ZAP is also automatically finalized when the analysis ends.

Optionally, it's also possible to define the value of each parameter through the builder. Here are some examples:

```java
// To use an instance of ZAP that is already executing, it's only necessary to inform ZAP's host and port
ZapInfo runningZapInfo = ZapInfo.builder().buildToUseRunningZap("localhost", 8080);

// To automatically start ZAP, the directory where ZAP is installed is required
ZapInfo runZapInfo = ZapInfo.builder().buildToRunZap(8080, "C:\\ZAP");

// To run ZAP via Docker, Docker must be locally installed and the application must have permission to run Docker
ZapInfo dockerZapInfo = ZapInfo.builder().buildToRunZapWithDocker(8080);

// The attributes can also be manually defined (dockerZapInfo is equivalent to newDockerZapInfo, for instance)
ZapInfo newDockerZapInfo = ZapInfo.builder().port(8080).shouldRunWithDocker(true).build();

// The 'path' attribute is enough to make sure ZAP will be automatically started
ZapInfo newRunZapInfo = ZapInfo.builder().port(8080).path("C:\\ZAP").build(); // equivalent to runZapInfo

// Lastly, both strategies can be used together
ZapInfo runningZapInfoWithTimeout = ZapInfo.builder().initializationTimeoutInMillis(30000L).buildToRunZap(8090, "C:\\ZAP");
```

### AuthenticationInfo

While `ZapInfo` stores everything related to ZAP, `AuthenticationInfo` keeps all the parameters needed for authentication. A builder is also provided to help create objects of this class. It has two main methods:

- `buildCasAuthenticationInfo()`
- `buildFormAuthenticationInfo()`

These methods make it easier to create `AuthenticationInfo` instances for each authentication type supported so far: CAS and form. Both methods receive as parameters the minimum necessary for each authentication type. However, it will normally be necessary to provide aditional parameters (to enable reauthentication, for instance). There are many options that can be set; the most common cases are presented below:

```java
// On form based authentication, the required parameters are just loginUrl, username and password
AuthenticationInfo formInfo = AuthenticationInfo.builder()
        .buildFormAuthenticationInfo("http://myapp/login", "username", "password");

// For CAS authentication, it's also necessary to inform a protected page for each context that will be analyzed
// This page will be automatically accessed after authentication and before ZAP's scan, avoiding redirections during the scan
AuthenticationInfo casInfo = AuthenticationInfo.builder()
        .buildCasAuthenticationInfo("http://myapp/login", "username", "password", "http://mydomain/myapp/protected/somePage");

// To enable reauthentication (making sure the whole analysis will be authenticated), simply define a value for either loggedInRegex or loggedOutRegex
AuthenticationInfo formReauthInfo = AuthenticationInfo.builder()
        .loggedInRegex("\\Q<a href=\"logout.jsp\">Logout</a>\\E")
        .buildFormAuthenticationInfo("http://myapp/login", "username", "password");

// It's possible to define pages that won't be authenticated (useful to exclude logout pages from the scan if reauthentication is not possible)
AuthenticationInfo formExcludeInfo = AuthenticationInfo.builder()
        .excludeFromScan("http://myapp/logout")
        .buildFormAuthenticationInfo("http://myapp/login", "username", "password");
```

### AnalysisInfo

This tiny class keeps information related to the analysis:

- `targetUrl`: URL of the application that will be scanned;
- `analysisTimeoutInMinutes`: analysis timeout;
- `analysisType`: analysis type. There are three types available: `WITH_SPIDER`, `WITH_AJAX_SPIDER` e `ACTIVE_SCAN_ONLY`.

These types are defined in the [`AnalysisType`](src/main/java/br/com/softplan/security/zap/api/model/AnalysisType.java) enum. `WITH_SPIDER` is the default type, which executes [ZAP's Spider](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsSpider) before the [Active Scan](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsAscan). For applications that rely on AJAX, it might be interesting to execute the available [AJAX Spider](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpAddonsSpiderAjaxConcepts) after the default Spider is executed. The type `WITH_AJAX_SPIDER` defines this strategy. Lastly, `ACTIVE_SCAN_ONLY` executes only the Active Scan. This is useful when the application navigation was done through a proxy with ZAP (via Selenium tests, for instance) and there is no need to run the Spider.

The `AnalysisInfo` instance is passed to `ZapClient`'s `analyze()` method. Therefore, it's possible to execute different analysis from the same `ZapClient` instance.

### ZapReport

The `analyze()` method returns a `ZapReport` instance that holds the reports generated by ZAP. Besides those, a new report is also generated with all the URLs visited by the Spider. This new report is important because it can be used to show if the Spider did, in fact, navigate through the application. Depending on these results, it might be possible to conclude if the authentication actually worked.

## Examples

Running an analysis on an executing instance of ZAP:

```java
ZapInfo zapInfo = ZapInfo.builder().buildToUseRunningZap("localhost", 8080);
ZapClient zapClient = new ZapClient(zapInfo);
ZapReport zapReport = zapClient.analyze(new AnalysisInfo("http://localhost:8090/bodgeit", 120));

System.out.println(zapReport.getHtmlReportAsString());
System.out.println(zapReport.getHtmlSpiderResultsAsString());
```

Running an analysis with automatic ZAP initialization and form authentication:

```java
ZapInfo zapInfo = ZapInfo.builder().buildToRunZap(8080, "C:\\ZAP");
AuthenticationInfo authenticationInfo = AuthenticationInfo.builder()
        .loggedInRegex("\\Q<a href=\"logout.jsp\">Logout</a>\\E")
        .buildFormAuthenticationInfo("http://localhost:8090/bodgeit/login.jsp", "user", "pass");
ZapClient zapClient = new ZapClient(zapInfo, authenticationInfo);
ZapReport zapReport = zapClient.analyze(new AnalysisInfo("http://localhost:8090/bodgeit", 120));

System.out.println(zapReport.getHtmlReportAsString());
System.out.println(zapReport.getHtmlSpiderResultsAsString());
```
